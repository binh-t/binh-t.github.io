						<p>Western Digital specializes in digital storage. For a good chunk of time,

						around writing firmware for many of WD's products. I started out writing firmware for the companys SAS/SATA
						2.5 inch drives. Then I moved onto writing tests and tools for validation of the company's first PCI-E NVMe 
						SSD, and then firmware bringup for WD's hybrid SSD/HDD drive. Towards the end of my tenure, my time was spent
						on the Performance team, analyzing and writing firmware to improve the performance capabilities of WD's 
						traditional HDD products.

					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>AppCap is a jailbroken iPhone tweak I wrote a few years back. Back when I felt that I was spending way
							too much time on my phone, it was an app that let you put restrictions on when you could use your apps.
							For example, I would restrict the Facebook app to my apartments GPS location, so I couldn't check it 
							in class. I would only let the Mail app launch 5 times per day, so I wouldn't constantly
							check my email. I'd limit games to >50% battery, so my phone wouldn't die because I wanted to squeeze
							in a few extra levels. The limits were completely customizable on an app by app basis, and cover a 
							vast range of possibilities, like time, calender, location, frequency of usage, data usage, etc. You can
							still find it in the Cydia store today, although it hasn't been updated for the latest iOS. Here are some
							nice things a few websites had to say about it:</p>
